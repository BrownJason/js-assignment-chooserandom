# ChooseRandom Assignment

In this assignment, students are tasked with writing a function, ```chooseRandom```, which takes an array and a number and returns a new array containing the given number of random elements selected from the given array. Students should use the MDN documentation and the information from their lesson about transducers to create this function. Lastly, students must export their ```createRandom``` function from the lib.js file in order to run the included test cases.

## Goal

---

Expose students to functional programming fundamentals by having them use transducers which were introduced in ES6 and immutably transform arrays. Unfortunately, because ```chooseRandom``` should do exactly what it says, it will not be referentially transparent and therefore is not a pure function.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement chooseRandom function
- [ ] Should return an array
- [ ] Should not mutate the array passed in
- [ ] Should return a random array
- [ ] Should return an array of the passed in length
- [ ] Run command ```npm test``` and passed all tests successfully
